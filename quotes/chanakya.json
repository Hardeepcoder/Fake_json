They are enemies. It is attachment that destroys all love.\r\n\r\nWealth, a friend, a wife, and a kingdom may be regained; but this body when lost may never be acquired again.\r\n\r\nPoverty, disease, sorrow, imprisonment and other evils are the fruits borne by the tree of one\u2019s own sins.\r\n\r\nThere are three gems upon this earth; food, water, and pleasing words \u2014 fools (mudhas) consider pieces of rocks as gems.\r\n\r\nAs a calf follows its mother among a thousand cows, so the (good or bad) deeds of a man follow him.\r\n\r\nWho realises all the happiness he desires? Everything is in the hands of God. Therefore one should learn contentment.\r\n\r\nHe who forsakes his own community and joins another perishes as the king who embraces an unrighteous path.\r\n\r\nGenerosity, pleasing address, courage and propriety of conduct are not acquired, but are inbred qualities.\r\n\r\nA learned man is honoured by the people.A learned man commands respect everywhere for his learning. Indeed,learning is honoured everywhere.\r\n\r\nBeauty is spoiled by an immoral nature;noble birth by bad conduct; learning, without being perfected; and wealth by not being properly utilised.\r\n\r\nMoral excellence is an ornament for personal beauty;righteous conduct,for high birth; success for learning;and proper spending for wealth.\r\n\r\nPurity of speech, of the mind, of the senses, and a compassionate heart are needed by one who desires to rise to the divine platform.\r\n\r\nOur bodies are perishable,wealth is not at all permanent and death is always nearby.Therefore we must immediately engage in acts of merit.\r\n\r\nWhat good can the scriptures do to a man who has no sense of his own? Of what use is as mirror to a blind man?\r\n\r\nThose base men who speak of the secret faults of others destroy themselves like serpents that stray onto anthills.\r\n\r\nBeauty is spoiled by an immoral nature; noble birth by bad conduct;learning, without being perfected;andwealth by not being properly utilised.\r\n\r\nLow class men desire wealth;middle class men both wealth and respect;but the noble,honour only;hence honour is the noble man\u2019s true wealth.\r\n\r\nHe who has wealth has friends and relations; he alone survives and is respected as a man.\r\n\r\nAccumulated wealth is saved by spending just as incoming fresh water is saved by letting out stagnant water.\r\n\r\nSwans live wherever there is water, and leave the place where water dries up; let not a man act so \u2014 and comes and goes as he pleases.\r\n\r\nThe power of a king lies in his mighty arms;that of a brahmana in his spiritual knowledge; and that of a woman in her beauty youth and sweet words.\r\n\r\nHe who gives up shyness in monetary dealings, in acquiring knowledge, in eating and in business, becomes happy.\r\n\r\nTime perfects all living beings as well as kills them; it alone is awake when all others are asleep. Time is insurmountable.\r\n\r\nBy means of hearing one understands dharma, malignity vanishes, knowledge is acquired, and liberation from material bondage is gained.\r\n\r\nThe poor wish for wealth; animals for the faculty of speech; men wish for heaven; and godly persons for liberation.\r\n\r\nLearning is a friend on the journey; a wife in the house; medicine in sickness; and religious merit is the only friend after death.\r\n\r\nThe learned are envied by the foolish; rich men by the poor; chaste women by adulteresses; and beautiful ladies by ugly ones\r\n\r\nA thing may be dreaded as long as it has not overtaken you, but once it has come upon you, try to get rid of it without hesitation.\r\n\r\nShe is a true wife who is clean (suci), expert, chaste, pleasing to the husband, and truthful.\r\n\r\nWhen one is consumed by the sorrows of life, three things give him relief: offspring, a wife, and the company of the Lord\u2019s devotees.\r\n\r\nLearning is like a cow of desire. It, like her, yields in all seasons. Like a mother, it feeds you on your journey. Therefore learning is a hidden treasure\r\n\r\nAs long as your body is healthy and under control and death is distant, try to save your soul; when death is imminent what can you do?\r\n\r\nHe who runs away from a fearful calamity, a foreign invasion, a terrible famine, and the companionship of wicked men is safe.\r\n\r\nDo not keep company with a fool for as we can see he is a two-legged beast.Like an unseen thorn he pierces the heart with his sharp words.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the pralaya(universal destruction)the oceans are to exceed their limits and seek to change,but a saintly man never changes.\r\n\r\nHe who befriends a man whose conduct is vicious, whose vision impure, and who is notoriously crooked, is rapidly ruined.\r\n\r\nAvoid him who talks sweetly before you but tries to ruin you behind your back, for he is like a pitcher of poison with milk on top.\r\n\r\nEven if a snake is not poisonous, it should pretend to be venomous.\r\n\r\nNever make friends with people who are above or below you in status. Such friendships will never give you any happiness.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the fear approaches near, attack and destroy it.\r\n\r\nThe earth is supported by the power of truth; it is the power of truth that makes the sun shine and the winds blow; indeed all things rest upon truth.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s biggest power is the youth and beauty of a woman.\r\n\r\nPurity of speech,of the mind, of the senses,and the of a compassionate heart are needed by one who desires to rise to the divine platform.","q_hindi":""},{"id":"49","person":"chanakya","quote":"Chanakya on Religion","q_full":"God is not present in idols.

Can we call a crow an eagle (garuda) simply because he sits on the top of a tall building.\r\n\r\nSinfully acquired wealth may remain for ten years; in the eleventh year it disappears with even the original stock.\r\n\r\nHe who wears unclean garments, has dirty teeth, is a glutton, speaks unkindly and sleeps after sunrise \u2013 although he may be the greatest personality \u2014 will lose the favour of Lakshmi.\r\n\r\nEschew wicked company and associate with saintly persons.
